All sovereigns are fundamentally an Affliction, Figuratively a chunbk of reality walking around.

But they also have a primary trait of the remaining four which affects many things.

Stuff Sovereigns are Sovereigns of Action. They have fast miracles, like a surge of miraculous power, and they operate on immediate timescales.

Literal Sovereigns are Sovereign Bondholders. Their miracles are like reality trying to prove something true. Their miracles are slow, but almost impossible to resist head on, a shepard tone of power, and they operate on seasonal timescales.

Thing Sovereigns are Sovereign Presents. Their miracles are like a surprise birthday party where you get a present, a box with a mystery inside, which could be anything from a dollar store gag gift to an increadibly personal one of a kind thing that you could not have imagined...

Distinction Sovereigns are exceptions and VIPs. Their miracles are like noticing something...

Literal Sovereigns and Distinction Sovereigns can take some of their domain and share it with other Sovereigns whom they act a Suzerain to.
